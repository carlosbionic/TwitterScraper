# TwitterScrapign
A Jupyter Notebook that scrapes a Twitter account

This Jupyter Notebook is a very basic Twitter scraping project.

From a given Twitter account, it prints the total number of tweets, number of following and number of followers.
It also prints some of the tweets with the date and its description.
